My Project is a simple user friendly project that shows how the company has performed in the last 6 months(Charts), enables admin creation and authentication and also enables the admin to create a new driver, sort,filter through the table data and also download records.
My project starts with the HomePage where you can find the Company Charts, login my accessing it through the navbar and also the signup.
When clicked on login, the project takes you to the login page and if you don't have the credentials, you must sign up as there is also a link to the signup page.
My project is structured in a way that no other page can be accessed without logging in for better security
After logging in, you are redirected to the admin homepage and there you have 2 options to either save the driver or to save a shipment(Not Working)
When clicked on View Drivers, you have the option to insert,edit or delete a recor as my CRUD operations are working well.
Sorting, Filtering and Searching are available for the driver data table and also Pagination works for the table data and of course downloading of records is avaliable.
Additionally, you can change the language to any other language that you understand(English,Kinyarwanda,Spanish,French) as my system supports multi-languages.

Thank you!!
